This repository contains a C# project which can be used to authenticate a user to the Spotify API. The multiple endpoints can be used to first request an access code and with that access code get a access token which can be used to make further API calls.

Before running the appilication you should create a Spotify Developer account. The clientId, clientSecret and the redirectUrl must be copied from the dashboard to the AuthenticationController
